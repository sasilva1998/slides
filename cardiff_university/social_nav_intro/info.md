# Title

Towards Socially Accepted Robot Navigation

# Abstract

In order for a robot to move and be accepted in social spaces (i.e. environments shared with people) such as museums and restaurants, they must navigate in a safe and comfortable way for the humans around it. Robots operating in this kind of environment got to avoid discomforting humans by getting too near to them and also respect their social cues. Although there are some well known social navigation approaches, these still have notably disadvantages like local minima or being for specific scenarios only.

In this talk, I will briefly tell you how I got involved in social robot navigation, an introduction into this topic and will show you a novel social robot navigation framework capable of generating feasible comfortable paths around humans. Our approach has been tested in both real life and simulated experimental tests using a Pepper Robot.

# Biography

I am a research assistant at Cardiff University mainly working on social robot navigation. I am a pythonist and my main interest involve robotics, embedded systems and IoT. I am co-founder of FunPython Community from Ecuador with which I give talks about different tech topics. I finished obtained my Bachelors Degree at Ecuador in 2021. I have been involved in different graduation projects regarding IoT and SLAM. I have participated and contributed to two researchs on SLAM and social navigation.
