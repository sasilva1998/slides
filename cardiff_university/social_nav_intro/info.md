# Title

Towards Socially Accepted Robot Motions

# Abstract

In order for a robot to move and be socially accepted in spaces (i.e. environments shared with people) such as museums and restaurants, they must navigate in a safe and comfortable way for humans around it. Robots operating in this kind of environment by avoiding getting to near to humans and also respect their social cues. Although there are some well known social navigation approaches, these still have notably disadvantages like local minima or not generalized for different types of scenarios.

In this talk, I will briefly tell you how I got involved in social robot navigation, an introduction into this topic and will show a social robot navigation which is being worked right now. This framework is capable of online path planning, which has been tested in both real life and simulated experimental tests with a Pepper Robot.

# Biography

I work as a research assistant at cardiff university. Currently, my main area is social robot navigation. I am co-founder of FunPython community from Ecuador, dedicated to generate and share knowledge at different talks. I finished obtained my Bachelor Degree at Ecuador in 2021. I have been involved in different graduation projects regarding IoT and robot SLAM. I have participated and contributed to two researchs on SLAM and social navigation.
