# Title

## Towards Socially Accepted Robot Navigation

## What is social navigation and how I got involved

## 

# Abstract

In order for robots to move and be accepted in social spaces (i.e. environments shared with people) such as museums and restaurants, they must navigate in a safe and comfortable way in regard to the surrounding humans. Robots operating in this kind of environment must avoid discomforting humans by respecting their social cues. Although there are some well known social navigation approaches, these still have notably disadvantages like local minima or being successfully for very specific scenarios only.

In this talk, I will briefly present how I got involved in social robot navigation, an introduction into this topic and I will also show you a first version of a novel online social robot navigation framework capable of generating feasible comfortable paths around humans in social spaces. Our approach has been tested in both real life and simulated experimental tests using a Pepper Robot.

# Biography

I am a research assistant at Cardiff University mainly working on social robot navigation. I am a pythonist and my main interests include robotics, embedded systems and IoT. I am co-founder of FunPython Community from Ecuador with which I give talks about different tech topics. I obtained my Bachelors Degree from Escuela Superior Polit√©cnica del Litoral in 2021. I have colaborated in different graduation and research projects regarding IoT and robot SLAM.
